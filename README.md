# ----VRChat-Udon-AntiCheat-System: FAC----
FAC - Frenetic Anti Cheat, designed to try and give more power to world developers allowing for better cheat prevention against various VRChat oversights or flaws (primarily good for game worlds but can be used in any other type of worlds.)

please be aware: it is not my job to protect against a 3rd party client user, FAC is to prevent the "normal" players from abusing built-in features in vrchat, it is not possible to protect against a 3rd party client user because vrchat systems use a peer to peer like system making it where developers cannot do any form of true server sided verification.

if you come across a hacker you should
1. record them
2. contact vrchat support
3. if the issue is severe suchas the hacker is able to change their DisplayName then look on: https://feedback.vrchat.com/ and make a canny or upvote a canny so vrchats internal team can stop being lazy hopefully fix issues/ do their jobs.

# **{Installation}**

1. download the FAC unitypackage from: https://github.com/FreneticFurry/VRChat-Udon-Anti-Cheat-System/releases
2. import the FAC unitypackage into your unity project
3. have TMP/ TextMeshPro installed properly
4. use the FAC prefab and everything should be ready to go

if you want to use seats within your world its recommended to use the "Seat.cs" on all of them so they properly work! otherwise they may cause false flags.

# **{Known Issues}**

1. sometimes players can be set to 0 improperly
2. flying doesnt get caught properly when detection point is different
3. other minor fixes are needed but currently shouldn't be a problem

# **{Future Update Plans}**

1. FAC rewrite, FAC could use some touch ups and better logic in alot of spots and i feel like ive gotten better at coding so im rewriting the entire thing to overall make FAC better

Note: im taking my time and doing QA tests to better ensure the FAC rewrite will release in a very good and very stable state unlike prior releases.
