# VRChat-Udon-Anti-Cheat-System
{VRChat general warning}

The VRChat devs have hired some sus (pedo) individuals & there could be more so my suggestion is just not interacting with the VRChat team :)

{What This protects against}

1. Collider Flying
2. Seat Cheating
3. OVR Advanced & gogo loco abuse
4. Menu Bugging
5. Sticking heads through walls
6. Reach/ Long arm manipulation
7. Speed manipulation
8. Mirror's & Camera cheating

this will not prevent someone who is using 3rd party software, that is EAC's job not mine!

{How To Use}

1. download from the releases section and place anti cheat prefab into the scene!
2. ensure that the "Enforce Player Height" is turned on in VRCWorld

if a seat exists please use the "Seat" code on it so it will actually work!

{Complications}

1. VRChat devs do not allow access to avatars so this is about the best that i can think of for things such as collider flying
2. if the vrchat devs with Udon 2 decide to not be inept then actual things can be created! if access & other things happen with Udon 2 this'll get a update accordingly to hopefully make it better!
3. unfortunately world creators also may not outright ban players from their worlds so this system will detect and allow the creator to either a respawn them after being detected as a cheater or b place them into a per server cheater room to ban players per instance (ik its dumb but its the vrchat devs so what'd you expect from them.)

{Planned Future Updates}

1. adding detection for: Player Blocking, if a player blocks another then they cannot see each other and in something like a game world that makes things very difficult so making players visible when blocked will surfice!

{Known Issues}

1. Players can use "UI" to slightly bypass the anti Mirror's & Camera but will eventually get fixed if possible.
2. Player Ragdolls DONT work currently & this may not get fixed because ragdolls are very very cosmetic.
3. i forgot to do the Spawn Protection so it just doesnt work currently, oopsies (will be fixed in the next update)

{Terms}

you may redistribute this code & even edit it, i only ask that you credit me for the code!
