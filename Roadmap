~{Roadmap (Development)}~

1. Add a method to verify if a play should be able to actually see a Pickupable object
2. Fix a slight issue with seats in some very weird cases thinking a player is cheating/ speeding
3. Refine existing methods
5. Make a new method for anti collider viewing to prevent weird cases of players getting placed where they shouldn't when anti speed is turned off
6. Add Micro checks for some things
7. Make a new Flight Detection thats more compatible with Ragdolls
