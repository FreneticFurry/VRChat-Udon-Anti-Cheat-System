~{Current Development}~

(Done Things)
1. Change the Collider viewing to allow for Layers to be used for ignoring colliders aswell (along with reintroducing the ignoring of objects parented to a tool object properly)
2. Refine existing methods
3. Player Blocking detection (so players arnt just invisible and hard to even notice when playing something like a game world)
4. Fix a slight issue with seats in some very weird cases thinking a player is cheating/ speeding

(Not Done Things)
1. Add a new setting for Detection to allow a detection zone or to just prevent players from cheating eg. attempted to fly the player got placed where they was before attempting to fly
2. Add a method to verify if a player should be allowed to pickup a VRC_Pickup object (eg. being behind a wall and sticking hands through the wall to grab or do things they shouldn't *cough* vr players *cough*)
3. Make a new method for anti collider viewing to prevent weird cases of players getting placed where they shouldn't when anti speed is turned off
4. Make a new Flight Detection thats more compatible with Ragdolls
